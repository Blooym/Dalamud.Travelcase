## About 
Travelcase is a plugin that lets you set per-character, per-zone gearsets and glamours. When entering a specified zone, the plugin will automatically change your gear and glamour to the specified set as long as it is valid and passes the validation checks. This is useful if you like to put on a coat when entering a snowy area, or want to cool off in beach zones.

## Features
- Set per-character per-zone gearsets and glamours
- "Roleplay Only" mode to only change gear and glamour when you have the RP status enabled
- Full localization support
- Supports a large number of zones, and will automatically add new zones when they are added to the game
